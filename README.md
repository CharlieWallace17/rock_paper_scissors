In order to practice coding in JavaScript, I've designed a rock, paper, scissors game. The user is prompted for a move by an alert box. They may enter "rock", "paper", or "scissors", and then press "OK". Then, the outcome of the round will be printed to the console. After 5 rounds, the game ends, and the final score is printed to the console.
